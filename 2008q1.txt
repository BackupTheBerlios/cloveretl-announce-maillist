Subject: [Cloveretl-announce] New CloverETL release 2.3.4
Message-ID: <47A6D747.6050904@centrum.cz>

Dear members of CloverETL  announce list !

We would like to announce that Clover team has recently released
version 2.3.4 of Clover.ETL tool.
We apologize for delay of this message.

The 2.3.4 release is mostly maintenance release with fixes of reported
bugs. However, the 2.3.x branch in general brings following improvements:

+ new extension point for build-in JDBC drivers - a JDBC connection now can be defined also via
	identifier of a build-in JDBC driver instead direct parameters 'dbDriver' and 'driverLibrary'
+ new engine plugin - 'org.jetel.jdbc', which now contains only MySQL build-in JDBC driver
+ the Dedup compoment has new rejected port, where all duplicated records are resent
+ the set of available functions in the Clover transformation language was extended
	- is_blank()
	- is_ascii()
	- is_number()
	- is_integer()
	- is_date()
	- remove_diacritic()
+ the javolution library was updated to the version 5.1
+ the commons-logging library was updated to the version 1.1
+ the DBLookupTable has new parameter "storeNulls", which determines whether the internal cache will
	store also a 'null' database response
+ method DataField.copyFrom() is now deprecated - developers should use setValue(DataField) instead
+ added new component "DB2 Data Writer" - DB2 bulk loader
+ added new component "Informix Data Writer" - Informix bulk loader
+ added new component "MSSQL Data Writer" - SQL Server bulk loader
+ most of the readers are able to read direct from STDIN - use '-' character in fileURL parameter for this purpose
+ most of the writers are able to write direct to STDOUT - use '-' character in fileURL parameter for this purpose
+ usage of the 'Check foreign key' component was slightly changed - check documentation


With my best regards !

Subject: [Cloveretl-announce] Released Clover.ETL version 2.4
Message-ID: <47BD538E.6010100@centrum.cz>

New version (2.4) of Clover.ETL engine has been released. It brings many 
improvements in graph execution, database communication and also 
extensions of Clover Transformation Language (CTL)

Most notably, we have introduced new graph execution management which 
allows us to run several transformation graphs within the same JVM 
instance at the same time. Also, it is possible to limit the amount of 
CPU resources (threads) used by Clover during graph's runtime. Other 
interesting extension is ability to run transformations in transaction 
mode - transformation graph can be re-set to its original state - that 
allows processing of data in small chunks - similarly to database 
"triggers".
List of other (smaller) improvements:

    * sftp protocol support for readers which use multifile reader
    * possibility of copying ByteDataField as BLOB
    * new implementation of "partition by range" feature with range 
lookup table usage
    * field unquoting before setting value by delimited and universal 
data parsers
    * the set of available functions in the Clover transformation 
language was extended by more than 20 new functions
    * Clover transformation language supports two new variable types, 
byte array and record
    * some components have new optional "rejected" port(s) 
(AproxMergeJoin, CheckForeignKey, DBJoin, LookupJoin)
    * DBOutputTable accepts more queries at once; new jetel-sql query 
syntax introduced
    * DBOutputTable has new attribute "errorAction" - COMMIT or ROLLBACK 
on errors
    * StructureWriter has 3 input ports: "body", "header" and "footer". 
There can be different masks for each input port
    * all component attributes, which contain a java code or a Clover TL 
language code, are not resolved for special characters
    * new graph processing facility - GraphExecutor, GraphPool
    * new component XmlWriter with example graphXmlWriter.grf
    * new component SpeedLimiter
    * XLSWriter can write to different sheets depending on record's value
    * data record metadata can specify a default field delimiter
    * the DataReader component recognizes too few or too many fields per 
record
    * the DataReader component has extended error port metadata - field 
number where an error occurs is attached
    * new JavaExecute component
    * new component attribute type - properties
    * ascending/descending flag in sort component can be specified per 
each key field
