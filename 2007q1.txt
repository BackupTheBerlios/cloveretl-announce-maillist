Subject: [Cloveretl-announce] New CloverETL release (2.0.3) and berlios.de
	server outage
Message-ID: <45A74F1B.6020304@centrum.cz>

Dear CloverETL users !

We have released yet another CloverETL 2.0 version - 2.0.3, which fixes
some small issues and
brings back some API calls which were lost during transition from 1.x
version to 2.x

Also, due to frequent outages of project's main hosting facility
berlios.de (which is unfortunately out of our reach)
we have set up an alternate  host - http://www.cloveretl.org/

Please, use this URL for accessing CloverETL site now on. We will make
sure that when berlios.de is back on-line,
this url will be redirected to the "original" site cloveretl.berlios.de

Subject: [Cloveretl-announce] CloverETL 2.1.0 released
Message-ID: <45D8249F.3080702@centrum.cz>

Dear CloverETL user !

CloverETL version 2.1.0 has arrived and brings many new features.

This release brings updates to architecture of transformation 
components.It allows checking of graph
configuration before run-time.
We have also added support for JMX which allows gathering of 
system-level statistics about run time
(component's CPU usage, various averages). These statistics can be 
displayed by any JMX client.
By reimplementing text data parsers, we achieved between 15-30% faster 
processing (depends on type of data).

Following is a list of significant changes:

+ Added new component "Data Generator" - generator of synthetic/random data
+ Added new component "Lookup Table Reader/Writer" - reader/writer of records from/to lookup table
+ Added new component "Lookup Join" - joins incoming data with selected lookup table
+ Added new component "JMS Reader" - receives JMS-messages
+ Added new component "JMS Writer" - sends JMS-messages
+ Added new component "Normalizer" - normalizes input records
+ Added new component "Denormalizer" - denormalizes input records
+ Added new component "Structure writer" - record mask formatter
+ Added new connection "JMS connection" - connection related with JSMReader and JMSWriter
+ developers can use new method for engine initialization - runGraph.initEngine()
+ new approach in DataField.setToDefaultValue() method;
  in case the default value is not preset, engine tries to set the field value to null
+ DBConnection has new calling method order;
  new DBConnection(), init(), getConnection()/getStatement(), free() 
  (connect() method is now private - call init() method instead)
+ Extended LookupTable interface by put() and remove() methods
+ all GraphElement(s) should implement checkConfig() method; this method is used for
  checking engine element configuration; related changes of transformation graph startup
  are described in runGraph class comments
+ components (Node descendants) should not override direct run() method, instead 
  for this purpose was introduced new execute() method
+ WatchDog thread has new wide logging and inter-component communication facilities
+ Added new data field type cbyte (compressed byte array)
+ All join components are ready to satisfy more slave input data streams


The CloverETL download is available from usual location: www.cloveretl.org or cloveretl.berlios.de
