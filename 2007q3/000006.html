<PRE>Dear CloverETL user !

We are happy to announce that new version (2.2) of CloverETL tool has 
been released.
It may be downloaded from its web portal [www.cloveretl.org]. We would also
like to remind you, that three other Clover related WEB sites are available:

<A HREF="http://wiki.cloveretl.org/">http://wiki.cloveretl.org/</A>   - Wiki - primary source of Clover documentation
<A HREF="http://forum.cloveretl.org/">http://forum.cloveretl.org/</A> - with Clover related discussion groups 
(replacing the old ones on berlios.de site)
<A HREF="http://bug.cloveretl.org/">http://bug.cloveretl.org/</A>   - where you may report bugs or submit 
feature requests

These are the most important changes/improvements in 2.2 version of Clover:

+ all read/write components have an uniform set of available attributes
    (i.e. dataPolicy, skipFirstLine, skipRows, numRecords, ...)
+ The examples package - example graphs are now distributed as an 'easy 
to use' eclipse project
+ engine binary release has this slightly different directory structure
    - [cloverETL]
    - [bin] run scripts
    - [docs] documentation, licenses
    - [lib] clover engine and other dependent libraries
    - [plugins] clover engine plugins
+ new shell/bat scripts for easy clover execution are present in the 
[bin] directory
+ the documentation was moved to wiki page [wiki.cloveretl.org]
+ new implementation of Aggregate component
+ new range lookup table was added to the lookup engine plugin
+ the DBOutputTable component now supports new output port for 
auto-generated keys from database;
   only MySQL and Oracle databases are currently supported
+ new XML reader based on xPath XML technology was added - XPathReader
+ the clover engine plugin framework was extended by new extension point 
for Transformation Language (TL) functions
   - most of the TL functions were externalized to the new engine plugin 
tlfunction
+ the field metadata has new attribute &quot;auto_filling&quot; - several 
auto-filled fields are now recognized - (source_name, source_timestamp, 
global_row_count, ...)
+ the clover transformation language increases usability - supports 
sequences, lookup tables, lists, maps and introduces many new functions, 
it also allows
   inclusion of external source files through &quot;import&quot; keyword.


Happy using !

CloverETL team
